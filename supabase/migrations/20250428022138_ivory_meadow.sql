  # Create leaderboard table

  1. New Tables
    - `leaderboard`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `player_name` (text)
      - `score` (integer)
      - `created_at` (timestamp with time zone)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `leaderboard` table
    - Add policies for:
      - Anyone can read leaderboard
      - Authenticated users can insert their own scores
